# Dotfiles
This repository contains my personal configuration files (dotfiles) for various applications and utilities that I use on my system. These configurations are tailored to my preferences and workflow. Feel free to explore, adapt, or fork them for your own use.

My font looks weird because I mainly use it for Hangul (the Korean alphabet). It's better for me to read.
